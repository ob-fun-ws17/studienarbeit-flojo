# Webby - The declarative Webserve

Webby is a Webserver, entirely written in Haskell. Which makes it cool, because it works functional!

### Get your Documents!
Well, its a Webserver. That's what it does...

### Configure it!
Via a handy configuration file, Webby satifies all your configurational needs (as long it's setting the port or the root directory)

### Look at that speed!!!
On the localhost we meassured an average of 160 ms response time.
Think of all the time you gain, compared to other, professional webservers. Read a book or enjoy the sunset (while waiting for your response)

**Webby | functional elegance **

##### Who did what?
Florian Pirchmoser:
- Response building and sending
- Different response types and statuscodes
- Reading from filesystem
- Passing configuration to affected functions
- Errorhandling (including basic structure for that)
- Testing and documenting own code

Johannes Br√ºhl:
- First structure
- Build
- Request parsing
- Configurating the port and context root
- Errorhandling (using basic structure from Flo)
- Testing and documenting own code
